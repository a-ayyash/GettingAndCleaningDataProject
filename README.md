Getting And Cleaning Data Project
=============================

This script goes through the following stages:
 - Loads files needed for each group which are Activity Labels and features.
 - Loads all the test data files
 - Loads all the train data files
 - Prepare proper column names for the Inertial Signal columns.
 - Construct a tidy data set for the train data
 - Construct a tidy data set for the test data
 - merges both data sets
 - Constructs the mean/std relevant measurements
 - Calculates the average for each value per user per activity

To best view the final result, please take a look at the CSV file in this repo.
